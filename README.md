# TravelBuddy

In the lights of Facebook Hack-a-project 2020, we were required to build a product that would empower communities and bring people together

We decided to build TravelBuddy, your flight host finder. The functionality is very simple: assume you would like to travel to a new country, but can't be bothered to be emprisoned with a tourist group, or prepare your journey by yourself. TravelBuddy will match you to a willing host in that country, who will introduce you to their culture, history, sites, best places, and who knows, maybe accomodate you and cook you traditional food! The goal is to create a culture bound between people and close the cutlutral gap between communities
